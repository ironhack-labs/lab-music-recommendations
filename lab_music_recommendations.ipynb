This indicates that the issue might be deeper within the `datasets` library's interaction with `torchcodec` or a dependency conflict not resolved by the initial installs. Since the goal is to load the audio data into a NumPy array, and the `datasets` library's audio decoding is causing issues, I will try converting the dataset to a pandas DataFrame first and then extracting the 'array' from the 'audio' column. This might bypass the problematic decoding step within the `datasets` library.\n",
